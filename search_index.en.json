Since the release of GitHub Pages this desire exists and since this day\nI involved myself in the development of multiple prototypes of websites with countless differente frameworks:\njekyll, hugo, react and svelte, using Vercel, Netlify... and now Zola. I can't remember how many times I deleted and\nrecreated my otaviocv.github.io repository.\nMany of these attempts didn't come to life for various reasons, I didn't like the themes,\nI wished multilanguage support, katex, having nothing to say or just the embarassement of exposing yourself.\nAfter much internal thinking, noting that newer frameworks enable a much simpler and pratical website and\nletting go of an aesthetic ideal this website comes to the world.\nIt is built with Zola and the Duckquill theme,\nit has an interesting aesthetics, support to many languages and\ncomments using Mastodon. One of the reasons of this introductory post is to test this integration.\nToday, my necessity to have a space to speak is greater than never and I believe to be able to say things\nthat matter to other people. The modern times required, also, a constant showcase and personal brand, a professional\naesthetics, that emulates the form of producing content for social media. This website intends to be all these things\nbesids also being a big index to all stuff I do.\nWithout artificial intelligence, I hope that here becomes a place of authenticity, learning and discussion.\nSee you there!\nFlowers\n"},{"url":"https://otaviocv.github.io/blog/on-the-future-of-machine-learning/","title":"The future of Machine Learning","body":"\n\t\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://otaviocv.github.io/interesting/","title":"Interesting things I found","body":"Following the idea of the small web\nand keeping a small list of references that influences me this is a mental log\nthat stores what I share with my family, friends, coworkers and, now, you.\nPodcasts\nEnglish\n\nSignals and Threads\nDisseminate: The Computer Science Research Podcast\n\nYoutube\nChannels\nEnglish\n\nCMU Database Group\n\n"},{"url":"https://otaviocv.github.io/","title":"otaviocv","body":"\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHi! I am otaviocv, I am from Brasil and I think a lot.\nI am graduated in physics and for the past 8 years I've\nbeen working as a Machine Learning Engineer. My mind wander\nto various places covering topics from very unrelated places like functional\nprogramming, type systems, compilers, cad software, design, puzzles, data engineering,\neditors and, obviously, machine learning.\nThis website was built to share ideas, create dialog spaces and be my place of free expression.\nMy plan is to share a few recurrent thoughs, prototypes, ideas in a more structured\nway and, hopefully, create a comunity on this specific style of presentation.\nThe blog section should be faced as a linear feed of acvities sumarizing\neverything in a single timeline. I made my best to localize everything but certain\ntopics aim specific audiences and may not be worth translating to all languages.\nBe welcomed!\n"}]
