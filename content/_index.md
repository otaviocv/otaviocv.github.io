Hi! I am **otaviocv**, I am from **Brasil** and I think a lot.
I am graduated in physics and for the past 8 years I've
been working as a Machine Learning Engineer. My mind wander
to various places covering topics from very unrelated places like functional
programming, type systems, compilers, cad software, design, puzzles, data engineering,
editors and, obviously, machine learning.

This website was built to share ideas, create dialog spaces and be my place of free expression.
My plan is to share a few recurrent thoughs, prototypes, ideas in a more structured
way and, hopefully, create a comunity on this specific style of presentation.

The blog section should be faced as a linear feed of acvities sumarizing
everything in a single timeline. I made my best to localize everything but certain
topics aim specific audiences and may not be worth translating to all languages.

Be welcomed!
