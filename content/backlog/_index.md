The place to store the spark before it fades away...

### 1. Post more things!

  - They are already there, _only in Portuguese_:
    - [Real Time tips and tricks: how to scale your machine learning practice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xZUpwiiJ68)
- `2025-10-26` The machine learning future

### 2. `2025-10-26` Variant Sudoku Solver

I spend a lot of time watching [Cracking The Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrackingTheCryptic)
where Simon and Mark solve *variant sudokus*, [sudokus](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)
that include more rules than the original 1 to 9
digits contraints on columns, rows and boxes, therefore I would like to explore
the idea of applying the contraint propagation method from the [Peter Norvig post](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html)
on solving sudoku with additional rules.
