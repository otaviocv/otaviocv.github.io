This is a text that I've been long waiting to write. After long reflections with my self
and probing various friends and coworkers I will give it a chance of becoming something.
I want to talk about the vision of a different future, a future where my life is easier
at training and deploying machine learning models.

# Small, Medium and Large scale machine learning. But not Huge


# The design of a library
