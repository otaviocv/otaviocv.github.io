It has been a while since I started thinking on building a webstie, a blog, a form of digital presence that is
out of social media or the closed internet. Since the release of _GitHub Pages_ this desire exists and since this day
I involved myself in the development of multiple prototypes of _websites_ with countless differente frameworks:
jekyll, hugo, react and svelte, using Vercel, Netlify... and now Zola. I can't remember how many times I deleted and
recreated my `otaviocv.github.io` repository.

Many of these attempts didn't come to life for various reasons, I didn't like the themes,
I wished multilanguage support, katex, having nothing to say or just the embarassement of exposing yourself.
After much internal thinking, noting that newer frameworks enable a much simpler and pratical website and
letting go of an aesthetic ideal this website comes to the world.

It is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and the [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one/) theme,
it has an interesting aesthetics, support to many languages and
comments using Mastodon. One of the reasons of this introductory post is to test this integration.

Today, my necessity to have a space to speak is greater than never and I believe to be able to say things
that matter to other people. The modern times required, also, a constant showcase and personal brand, a professional
aesthetics, that emulates the form of producing content for social media. This website intends to be all these things
besids also being a big index to all stuff I do.

Without artificial intelligence, I hope that here becomes a place of authenticity, learning and discussion.
See you there!
